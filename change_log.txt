05.05.2024 - Overhaul-1:
    - Overhaul complete.  
    - Generate Fractal function replaced with smaller functions with more customizability   
    - Fractal can be generated faster for larger ranges as well   
    - Many Particle and Single Particle collision   
    - Plots can be generated for every_single_collision and every_wall_collision    
    - Plots can be saved for each frame   
    - Range of gradients are sorted:
        1. based on the triangular matrix arrangement
            [1,1] [1,2] [2,1] [1,3] [3,1] [2,3] [3,2] .. []
        2. based on ascending order of the x-coordinate
            [1,1] [1,2] [1,3] [2,1] [2,3] [3,1] [3,2] .. []
    - Added video generator function
    - Added Color customizablilty for plots

05.05.2024 - Merged with Master
    - Created different main file for:
         - Many Particles - Given a slope-range
         - Single Particle - With given range
    - Precision argument added for collision (so repeated collisions are discarded)

Thoughts:
    - to add "all_hop" function OR "normal_to_gradient"

06.05.2024:
    - added info to README.md
    - created Examples/
